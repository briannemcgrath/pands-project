# Programming & Scripting Fisher's Iris Dataset Assignment Repository

Assignment Work - Analysis carried out on the Fisher's Iris Dataset. 

## Summary of Fisher's Iris Dataset:

The Fisher's Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of statistics and machine learning, introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". It consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers for three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset serves as a benchmark for various calssification and clustering algorithms and is widely used for species classification, exploratory data analysis, and model benchmarking.

Here is an overview of the dataset: 

- **Features:** The dataset contacts four features measured from each sample: 
1. Sepal Length (CM)
2. Sepal Width (CM)
3. Petal Width (CM)
4. Petal Length (CM)

- **Size & Quality:** The dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each species. This dataset is well-known for its high quality and cleanliness, with no missing values or anomalies. 

Overall, the Fisher's Iris dataset is a foundational dataset, providing a simple yet effective example for exploring concepts such as classification, clustering and feature selection. Its simplicity and clarity makes it an ideal starting point for beginners learning about data analysis and machine learning.

## Analysis: 
- Examine the content of the data set.
- Summary of each variable into a single text file.
- Histrogram of each variable to png files.
- Scatter plot of each variable.
- Analysis to gain insights into the relationships between variables. 
- Visualisation - Scatterplots, Boxplots, Histograms, Bar Charts etc. 
- Interpretation of findings. 

## Conclusion: 
In conclusion, this assignment provides an analysis of Iris flower characteristics based on the dataset, offering insights into their attributes. By combining our own findings with insights from previous literature, we have gained a deeper understanding of the dataset and it's relevance in statistical analysis. Through visualisations and analysis, we have explored the features of the dataset, identified patterns and relationships, and gained insights into the differences between different species of Iris flowers.
